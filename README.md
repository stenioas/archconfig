# Archlinux Installation

> ðŸ’¡ _**This project is a personal tool.** I created it to simplify my life and automate my Archlinux installation process. It reflects my personal choices and is not a tutorial, but rather a documented guide for my own use. Feel free to use it, adapt, modify, fork, and play around, but **use it at your own risk!** I hope it helps you too!_

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

This section provides a step-by-step guide to install Archlinux using the archinstall tool, the configuration files from this repository, and the `postinstall.sh` script.

- Test your connection:
  ```sh
  ping archlinux.org
  ```

### 2. Run Reflector to Improve Mirrors
