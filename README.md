# Archlinux Installation

> ðŸ’¡ _**This project is a personal tool.** I created it to simplify my life and automate my Archlinux installation process. It reflects my personal choices and is not a tutorial, but rather a documented guide for my own use. Feel free to use it, adapt, modify, fork, and play around, but **use it at your own risk!** I hope it helps you too!_

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

This section provides a step-by-step guide to install Archlinux using the archinstall tool, the configuration files from this repository, and the `postinstall.sh` script.

For advanced configuration, module customization, and details about the builder system, see the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md).

### 1. Connect Archinstaller to the Internet via iwctl

- Boot into the Archlinux installer.
- Start the interactive wireless tool:

```bash
iwctl
```

- Inside iwctl, run:

```bash
device list
station <device> scan
station <device> get-networks
station <device> connect <SSID>
exit
```

- Test your connection:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

### 2. Run Reflector to Improve Mirrors

- Update the mirrorlist for faster downloads:

```bash
reflector -c Brazil --latest 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist --verbose
```

_(Adjust country as needed)_

### 3. Update Package Database
